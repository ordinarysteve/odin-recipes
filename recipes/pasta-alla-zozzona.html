    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This pasta alla zozzona, or "dirty pasta," is made with a sauce that is a

    <h3>Step by Step how to make Pasta Alla Zozzona</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat, add onion, and cook until golden, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and pancetta, and cook until pancetta is crispy, about 2 minutes. Add sausage; cook  and stir until browned, about 5 minutes, adding additional olive oil as needed.</li>
      <li>Add marinara, stir, and cook for 15 minutes. Add salt, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil with a generous tablespoon of sea salt. Add rigatoni; cook until tender with a bite, about 13 minutes. Reserve a mug of pasta water, drain pasta, and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks in a bowl; add pecorino Romano and whisk until thick. Season with black pepper, and add a bit of reserved pasta water to loosen the egg sauce.</li>
      <li>Slowly whisk egg sauce into meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Stir sauce into rigatoni; taste, and finish with more cheese, salt, and black pepper. Garnish with fresh basil.</li>
