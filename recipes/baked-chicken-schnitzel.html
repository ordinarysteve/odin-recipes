    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Schnitzel, which originated in Eastern Europe, is a thin slice of meat
      that is breaded and fried. You can make it with chicken, pork, veal
      (wiener-schnitzel), and other types of meat. The word "schnitzel" comes
      from the German word "schnitt," which means "cut."
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
      <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step by Step how to make Baked Chicken Schnitzel</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking
        sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place the
        baking sheet in the oven as it preheats.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a
        solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet
        to 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour and paprika together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs, salt, and
        pepper together in a second shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon
        zest together in a third shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge one piece of chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten
        egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread
        crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded chicken, unstacked, onto a
        plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange chicken in a single layer
        on the hot sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue
        baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly
        browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
