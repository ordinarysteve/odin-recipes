    <h3>Step by Step how to make Quesabirria Tacos</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat sesame seeds, cumin, peppercorns, coriander seeds, cinnamon stick,
        cloves, and bay leaves in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and
        the sesame seeds begin to brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Heat beef broth in a medium-sized pot and turn to a low simmer.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add
        guajillo, ancho, and chile de arbol peppers, turning occasionally.
        Remove the peppers once they have started to blister a bit, 5 to 7
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the peppers in the pot of simmering broth. Cover and allow to
        simmer until the peppers are rehydrated and tender, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice 3/4 of the onion into thick slices and finely dice the rest. Put
        the diced onion aside. Add the thick slices to the pot, along with the
        garlic, and cook until the onion is browned, about 5 minutes. Remove and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining oil in the pot over medium-high heat, and add goat meat.
        Allow to brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the warmed spices, peppers and broth, onions, garlic, vinegar, salt,
        Oregano, and thyme into a blender. Allow to cool slightly before
        blending to prevent scalding yourself, about 5 minutes. Blend until very
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the blended sauce into the pot, and stir, scraping all the browned
        bits off the bottom of the pot. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat
        until the meat is very tender, about 2 ½ hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the meat from the sauce and allow to cool enough to shred. Shred
        the meat with your hands or with 2 forks. Stir in about 1/4 cup of the
        sauce. Blend the diced tomatoes until very smooth and add to the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, dip each tortilla in the pot of sauce and place in a
        hot pan. Add a bit of the meat mixture and a bit of cheese. Fold in half
        and brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the remaining sauce into 4 small bowls. Serve the tacos and sauce
        with the reserved diced onion, lime wedges, and cilantro.
      </li>
